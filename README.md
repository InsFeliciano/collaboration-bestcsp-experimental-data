# collaboration-bestcsp-experimental-data

Sharing of experimental data for validating computational methods as part of the BEST-CSP project, see <https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA22107>

This repository contains individual folders for each of the systems considered in this Action, and an example "System_template" to illustrate the format

Within each folder are sub folders for each of the physical properties, with .csv files for standardised recording of data. Keeping the experimental data
to a standard format will aid model building/ statistical assessment of results, and csv files are machine readable
