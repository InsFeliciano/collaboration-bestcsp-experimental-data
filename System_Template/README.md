# System Template

This is a template directory for an example system in the BEST-CSP project.
There should be a folder for each property associated with the system, and a csv file
that records the data, alongside appropriate metadata for how the data was generated.
There is absolutely no expectation that every property will be filled in for each system,
but please try to include as much detail as possible for the data that is recorded.

There should be a README.md in each System folder, with high level details about the system

## Submitting data

In an ideal world, data would be contributed by trackers, branching from this github repository, 
adding the data to the relevant place, and then submitting a Pull review, setting Isaac Sugden, Jonas Nyman, 
Doris Braun, Ivo Rietveld, and the working group lead as reviewers. However, it is fine to submit data via email 
and we can update the repo, but please try to include metadata either way

## Naming Conventions

csv files should be named system_property.csv

## README.md contents

within each README.md, name of compound, SMILES, pictures etc. could be recorded
