# Format

Template file for recording Enthalpy of Formation Experimental data. It is expected that data that is contributed without a publication will attempt to follow the protocol established by WG2 at the Zagreb meeting, with important deviations noted. The file (csv) contains several columns:

## Identifer

A persistent identifier so that users can discuss individual results

## Form (REFCODE)

It is expected that this column will contain the common name of the polymorphic form, and if applicable, the CSD Refcode

## Temperature (K)

In Kelvin

## Value (kJ/mol)

Enthalpy of Fusion, in kJ/mol

## Comments

Anything the contributor considers pertinent to the reported value (pressure, ambient conditions etc.); please avoid commas and quote marks!

## Reference/Author

If the value is from the literature, then leave a DOI, otherwise, an identifier for the set of unpublished data. For example, I have used M_Dudek_2024.1 for the data contributed by Marta Dudek at the Zagreb meeting in March 2024

## Outside of columns

The final line in the file will be the Benchmark value. As an example (14/05/2024) I have used the average of temperature and enthalpy, and put the stdev.p in the comments. This should be replaced with a more thorough statistical analysis, that gives a higher weighting to data that was part of a set that included repeats, as agreed upon by WG6 before the Paris meeting.
