# Format

Template file for recording Solubility Experimental data. The file (csv) contains several columns:

## Form (REFCODE)

it is expected that this column will contain the common name of the polymorphic form, and if applicable, the CSD Refcode

## Temperature (K)

In Kelvin

## Value (x)

Solubility as mole fraction. TBD in Zagreb: we should decide on mole fraction vs mg/ml (of solvent not solution)

## Error

Self explanatory

## Comments

Anything the contributor considers pertinent to the reported value (pressure, ambient conditions etc.); please avoid commas and quote marks!

## Reference/Author

If the value is from the literature, then leave a DOI, otherwise, the email address of the reporter
